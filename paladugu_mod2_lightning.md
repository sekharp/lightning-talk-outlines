# Japanese: On Language and Programming
- My goal is to inform folks about the complexity of the Japanese writing system
- Also wanted to touch on the subject of comparing and contrasting Japanese writing with programming languages, using Ruby as a case study, given the pervasive trope that learning to code is like learning a hard language
- I've found more differences than similarities

## Written Japanese - It's Complicated

## Flexible, Ideographic, Multiple Concurrent Systems and More
- Japanese has three intertwined systems of writing
- Kanji, the main ideographic characters, came from China originally, though there are many specific to Japanese
- There are 2000+ characters in widespread use that educated adults should know, each with intrinsic meaning, different meaning in combinations, and 10+ readings per character
- Hiragana and Katakana are syllabic and building blocks of Japanese writing

## Examples of Japanese Writing
- Example sentence
- Kanji with many different readings
- Hiragana examples
- Katakana for different loan words, onomatopoeias, scientific words, for emphasis
- Note on furigana

## So, how does this compare to object-oriented programming languages, like Ruby?

#### Ruby - Flexible Yet Still Object-Oriented
- Example code given of a short file/class/method
- Takeaway - Ruby is powerful yet succinct, readable, English-like, and yet flexible with multiple ways to solve problems

#### More Differences than Similarities
- I think human language parallels are interesting and learning another language is a similarly long journey, but...
- Programming languages are formalized logic, which is a different world entirely, and intended for a machine, not another human/human brain
- In some ways, as one Quora user wrote, learning to program is like "learning to fill out a very long form"
- Human languages have much more irregularity and culture/history layered onto them
